Have you ever accidentally committed a .DS_Store file? or started at a new company and opened up a PR adding `.vscode`
or `.idea` folders to a repo's `.gitignore`? Keep those pesky user specific config files out of your repo easily by
creating a global gitignore file.

```gitignore:title=.gitignore
.DS_Store
.idea
.vscoe
```

Save this file off somewhere; I would recommend ~/.gitignore or maybe in your dotfiles repo, and then either run:

```shell
$ git config --global core.excludesFile /path/to/globalgitignore
```

or to your gitconfig

```ini:.gitconfig
[core]
    excludesfile = /path/to/globalgitignore
```

This does not replace the need for a repo's gitignore. I would still recommend keeping output and artifacts of your
code bases in repo-specific ignore files to 1. keep the context of things that a repo produces that we don't want to
version and 2. avoid every dev having to update their global gitignore.
