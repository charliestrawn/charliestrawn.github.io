# Getting Started with Gatsby

<!-- Texts -->

2021 seems like a good year to finally start blogging about software development and other things.
I set this site up using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) which I'm liking so far. It's been a while since
I've written Javascript, and it looks like a lot has changed for the better. The last time I built a serious
frontend Angular 1 was the bees knees. I've been wanting to get into React for a while and writing about it
and sharing what I learn seems like a decent way to make progress.

I'll probably write about some other random
things like running, cooking, and video games. We'll see. At some point I'll get around to cleaning up the test
posts from the themes.
